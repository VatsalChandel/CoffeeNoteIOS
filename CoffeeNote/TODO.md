# CoffeNote - Todo & Ideas

## App Overview
CoffeNote is an app for coffee enthusiasts to track the coffee shops they've visited, rate their experiences, and discover new places to explore.

---

## 📋 Project Setup & Foundation

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Create new iOS project in Xcode
- [ ] Set up Git repository
- [ ] Configure app bundle ID and signing
- [ ] Set minimum iOS version (recommend iOS 17+)
- [ ] Add required Info.plist entries (location permissions, etc.)

### Firebase Setup
- [ ] Create Firebase project
- [ ] Add iOS app to Firebase project
- [ ] Download and add GoogleService-Info.plist
- [ ] Install Firebase SDK via SPM
- [ ] Enable Firestore Database
- [ ] Enable Firebase Authentication
- [ ] Configure Apple Sign In in Firebase Console
- [ ] Set up Firestore security rules

### Xcode Capabilities
- [ ] Add "Sign in with Apple" capability
- [ ] Add location permissions to Info.plist
  - [ ] NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription (e.g., "CoffeNote uses your location to help you log and map the coffee shops you visit.")
- [ ] Add MapKit framework

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- [ ] Create authentication view model
- [ ] Design sign-in screen UI
- [ ] Implement Apple Sign In flow
  - [ ] Request authorization
  - [ ] Handle callback
  - [ ] Link to Firebase
- [ ] Create authenticated/unauthenticated state management
- [ ] Add sign-out functionality
- [ ] Handle authentication errors
- [ ] Create user profile on first sign-in

---

## 💾 Data Models & Structure

### Data Models
- [ ] Create CoffeeShopVisit model
  - [ ] id: String (unique identifier)
  - [ ] userId: String (Firebase user ID)
  - [ ] shopName: String
  - [ ] address: String
  - [ ] latitude: Double
  - [ ] longitude: Double
  - [ ] placeID: String? (optional, from MKMapItem)
  - [ ] itemsOrdered: [String] (array of items)
  - [ ] rating: Double (0.5 increments, range 0.5-5.0)
  - [ ] price: Double (USD)
  - [ ] notes: String?
  - [ ] dateVisited: Date
  - [ ] photoURL: String? (for premium feature)

- [ ] Create WantToGoLocation model
  - [ ] id: String
  - [ ] userId: String
  - [ ] shopName: String
  - [ ] address: String
  - [ ] latitude: Double
  - [ ] longitude: Double
  - [ ] notes: String?
  - [ ] dateAdded: Date

### Firebase/Firestore Structure
- [ ] Design Firestore collection structure:
  - `/users/{userId}/visits/{visitId}` - visited shops
  - `/users/{userId}/wishlist/{locationId}` - want to go
  - `/users/{userId}/profile` - user profile data
- [ ] Create Firestore manager/service class
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for visits
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for wishlist
- [ ] Add real-time listeners for data sync

**Decision Point:** Multiple visits to same shop
- Each visit = separate document with full location info
- Easier to query and aggregate
- Allows tracking changes over time (prices, ratings, items)

## 🤔 Important Questions & Decisions

### ✅ Decided
- **Rating scale:** 1-5 stars with 0.5 increments
- **Multiple visits:** Yes - each visit is a separate entry
- **Photo uploads:** Premium feature only
- **Authentication:** Apple Sign In
- **Social features:** Not in initial release
- **Monetization timing:** Phase 2, after core features
- **Location input:** MKLocalSearch (primary) + Current Location (secondary) + Manual (fallback)
- **Items field:** List of items (users can add multiple items per visit)
- **Currency:** USD only for now (can expand later)
- **Free tier limit:** 25 shops maximum
- **Free tier restrictions:** 
  - Map page blocked (premium only)
  - "Want to Go" wishlist page blocked (premium only)
  - Visits list always available
- **Data export:** Not implementing initially (family & friends release)
- **App name:** TBD - can decide later before App Store submission
- **Privacy:** Clear disclosure about location usage for shop tracking

### ⚠️ To Decide Later
- [ ] **App name:** Need to check App Store availability before submission
- [ ] **Data export:** Consider adding in future if user base grows
- [ ] **International expansion:** Multiple currencies if going global

## 🔍 Potential Issues to Watch For

### Technical Challenges
- **Map performance:** With hundreds of pins, clustering is essential
- **Location accuracy:** GPS can be inaccurate indoors
- **Data aggregation:** Calculating stats efficiently across many visits
- **Image storage costs:** Photos in premium tier could get expensive
- **Network connectivity:** Require internet connection - show friendly message if offline

### Design Challenges
- **Form UX:** Adding a visit shouldn't feel tedious
- **Empty states:** First-time user experience is critical
- **Navigation:** 4 tabs - make sure it's not confusing
- **Search results:** Need good UX for location autocomplete

### Business Challenges
- **User retention:** How to keep users coming back?
- **Monetization timing:** When to introduce premium?
- **Competition:** Are there similar apps? What's unique?
- **Privacy:** Users are sensitive about location data

### How to Ask AI for Help

#### Example Prompts:

**For Task 4 (Data Models):**
```
"Create a Swift struct called CoffeeShopVisit that conforms to Codable and Identifiable. 
It should have these properties:
- id: String
- userId: String
- shopName: String
- address: String
- latitude: Double
- longitude: Double
- placeID: String?
- itemsOrdered: [String]
- rating: Double
- price: Double
- notes: String?
- dateVisited: Date
- photoURL: String?

Also add convenience methods to convert to/from Firestore dictionary format."
```

**For Task 18 (Star Rating Picker):**
```
"Create a SwiftUI view called StarRatingPicker that displays 5 stars and allows 
users to select a rating with 0.5 increments (half stars). The rating should be a 
@Binding<Double> with a range of 0.5 to 5.0. Show filled stars, half-filled stars, 
and empty stars as appropriate. Use SF Symbols for the stars."
```

**For Task 21 (Visit Card):**
```
"Create a SwiftUI view called VisitCardView that displays a CoffeeShopVisit in a 
card format. Show:
- Shop name (bold)
- Date visited
- Star rating (display-only stars)
- Price formatted as currency
- First 2-3 items ordered

Use a coffee-themed color scheme with browns and creams. Make it look modern 
and clean. Add a small coffee cup icon."
```

**For Task 25 (Map Annotations):**
```
"Create a custom MKAnnotation class for coffee shop locations. It should store 
the visit data and have properties for coordinate, title, and subtitle. Also create 
custom annotation views with different colored pins for visited shops (brown) vs 
wishlist shops (gold)."
```

### Tips for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Start with Foundation First**
   - Do Tasks 1-5 first (setup, models, theme)
   - These are prerequisites for everything else

2. **Build One Feature at a Time**
   - Complete all tasks for one feature before moving to next
   - Example: Finish auth (Tasks 6-9) before starting location

3. **Test After Each Task**
   - Run the app after completing each task
   - Make sure it compiles and works before moving on

4. **Use AI for Specific Components**
   - Ask for one view, one view model, or one service at a time
   - Don't ask for entire features in one prompt

5. **Iterate and Refine**
   - AI might not get it perfect first time
   - Ask for modifications: "Make the colors darker", "Add error handling"

6. **Keep Context**
   - Reference previously created components
   - Example: "Use the CoffeeShopVisit model we created earlier"

7. **Ask for Explanations**
   - "Explain how this code works"
   - "Why did you use @State here?"

### Task Dependencies

Some tasks depend on others:
- Task 20 depends on Tasks 16, 17, 18, 19
- Task 22 depends on Task 21
- Task 26 depends on Task 25
- Task 33 depends on Task 31, 32

Always complete dependencies first!

### Estimated Time Per Task
- Setup tasks (1-5): 30-60 min each
- Service tasks (6-15): 45-90 min each  
- UI component tasks (16-35): 30-120 min each

**Total development time: ~40-60 hours** across all 35 tasks
